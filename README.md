# Introduction

Parsely is a chrome extension that allows me to extract the text of a recipe from cooking websites so that I can view them without any extra text, ads, or videos

## Use

The app is deployed [on Heroku](https://parsely-web.herokuapp.com/) as I wait for Google's approval to publish it on the Chrome Web Store.

Parsely has been primarily tested with recipes from [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/). It also works with some recipes from [King Arthur Baking](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/). It may work on recipes from other sites; however these two are the only ones that have been tested.

The repository for the back-end is [here](https://github.com/daniellewhyte/capstone-back-end).
